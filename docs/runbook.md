## 1. Health Checks

### Endpoint

```
GET /health
```

No authentication required.

### Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "postgres": "connected",
    "qdrant": "connected",
    "buffer_depth": 0,
    "buffer_status": "ok",
    "sse_broker": "running",
    "uptime_seconds": 86400
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "9a4c58db-8d9f-4cad-9ec8-c9476e4af9a6",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-14T04:21:00Z"
  }
}
```

| Field (under `data`) | Healthy Value   | Unhealthy Value   |
|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `status`             | `"healthy"`     | `"degraded"` / `"unhealthy"` |
| `postgres`           | `"connected"`   | `"disconnected"`  |
| `qdrant`             | `"connected"`   | `"disconnected"`  |
| `buffer_status`      | `"ok"`          | `"high"` / `"critical"` |

Three status values:
- **`healthy`** (HTTP 200) — Postgres connected, buffer below 75% capacity.
- **`degraded`** (HTTP 200) — Postgres connected, but buffer above 75% capacity (`buffer_status: "critical"`).
- **`unhealthy`** (HTTP 503) — PostgreSQL is unreachable.

The endpoint returns 503 if and only if PostgreSQL is unreachable. Qdrant being down does NOT cause a 503 -- the system degrades to text search.

The `qdrant` field is omitted entirely when Qdrant is not configured (no `QDRANT_URL`).
The `sse_broker` field is omitted when SSE/NOTIFY is disabled.

### Kubernetes / Load Balancer Configuration

```yaml
# Kubernetes liveness probe
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 15
  failureThreshold: 3

# Kubernetes readiness probe
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
  failureThreshold: 2
```

For AWS ALB/NLB target groups, use `/health` with expected status 200.

---

## 2. Monitoring

### OTEL Metrics

Metrics are exported via OTLP/HTTP to the endpoint specified by `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`. The metric reader flushes every 15 seconds. Traces are batched every 5 seconds. If the endpoint is not set, OTEL is disabled (no-op providers). Set `AKASHI_OTEL_SAMPLE_RATE` (0.0–1.0, default 1.0) to enable head sampling when trace volume is high.

| Metric                         | Type      | Unit | Labels                                                    |
|--------------------------------|-----------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `http.server.request_count`    | Counter   | 1    | `http.method`, `http.route`, `http.status_code`, `akashi.agent_id` |
| `http.server.duration`         | Histogram | ms   | `http.method`, `http.route`, `http.status_code`, `akashi.agent_id` |
| `akashi.buffer.depth`          | Gauge     | 1    | _(none)_ |
| `akashi.buffer.dropped_total`  | Gauge     | 1    | _(none; ingress rejections due to capacity or shutdown drain)_ |
| `akashi.embedding.duration`    | Histogram | ms   | _(none)_ |
| `akashi.search.duration`       | Histogram | ms   | _(none)_ |
| `akashi.outbox.depth`          | Gauge     | 1    | _(none, via pg_class.reltuples estimate)_ |

Trace spans include `http.method`, `http.url`, `http.request_id`, `http.status_code`, `akashi.agent_id`, and `akashi.role`.

### What to Alert On

### Log-Based Alerts

Akashi logs JSON to stdout. Key log messages to monitor:

| Log Message (substring)                        | Meaning                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `"trace: flush failed"`                         | Event buffer failed to write to PostgreSQL            |
| `"trace: buffer at capacity"`                   | Event ingestion backpressure engaged (request rejected) |
| `"trace: buffer is draining"`                   | Node is shutting down; new event ingestion rejected      |
| `"search outbox: dead-letter entry"`            | Outbox entry exceeded 10 retry attempts               |
| `"search outbox: qdrant upsert"` + `error`      | Qdrant write failure (entries will retry)             |
| `"storage: notify reconnect attempt failed"`    | LISTEN/NOTIFY connection dropped, attempting recovery |
| `"conflict refresh failed"`                     | (Obsolete: conflicts are event-driven; RefreshConflicts is now a no-op) |
| `"rate limiter error, permitting request"`      | Limiter malfunction; request allowed (fail-open)      |
| `"rate limit exceeded"`                         | Agent hit rate limit; request rejected with 429       |

## 3. Common Failure Modes and Remediation

### Qdrant is Down

**Symptoms**: `/health` shows `qdrant: "disconnected"`. `POST /v1/search` returns degraded results (text fallback). Outbox entries accumulate.

**Impact**: Semantic (vector) search unavailable. Text-based search still works. No data loss -- new decisions continue to be written to PostgreSQL and queued in the `search_outbox` table.

**Remediation**:
1. Restore Qdrant.
2. Outbox worker will automatically sync accumulated entries on next poll cycle.
3. Verify: `SELECT count(*) FROM search_outbox WHERE attempts < 10;` should trend to 0.

**No operator intervention required** once Qdrant is restored.

---

### PgBouncer is Down

**Symptoms**: `/health` returns 503. All API requests fail with 500.

**Impact**: Complete service outage. No queries or writes succeed.

**Remediation**:
1. Restore PgBouncer.
2. If PgBouncer cannot be restored quickly, update `DATABASE_URL` to point directly to PostgreSQL and restart Akashi. Be aware that direct connections bypass pooling -- monitor connection count.

---

### NOTIFY Connection Drops

**Symptoms**: SSE subscriptions (`GET /v1/subscribe`) stop receiving updates. Log lines: `"storage: notify reconnect attempt failed"` followed by `"storage: notify connection restored"` on success.

**Impact**: Real-time event streaming paused. All other functionality (API, ingestion, search) is unaffected.

**Automatic recovery**: The connection reconnects with exponential backoff (500ms base, doubling, up to 5 attempts with jitter). All previously subscribed channels (`akashi_decisions`, `akashi_conflicts`) are re-established on reconnect.

**Remediation** (if auto-reconnect fails after 5 attempts):
1. Check that the `NOTIFY_URL` PostgreSQL instance is reachable.
2. Restart the Akashi process to re-establish the connection.

---

### Event Buffer Full

**Symptoms**: `POST /v1/trace` and `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}/events` return errors. Log line: `"trace: buffer at capacity"`.

**Impact**: New event ingestion is rejected (backpressure). Decisions and queries are unaffected.

**Hard cap**: 100,000 events in memory regardless of `AKASHI_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE`.

**Remediation**:
1. Check if PostgreSQL is accepting writes -- the buffer cannot flush if the database is down.
2. Check for log line `"trace: flush failed"` to identify the underlying cause.
3. If the load is legitimate, increase `AKASHI_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE` (up to 100,000) and restart.
4. Requests rejected at capacity increment `akashi.buffer.dropped_total`; clients must retry to avoid event loss.

---

### Idempotency Key Conflicts (409)

**Symptoms**: `POST /v1/trace`, `POST /v1/runs`, or `POST /v1/runs/{run_id}/events` returns `409 CONFLICT` with a message about idempotency key mismatch or request already in progress.

**Impact**:
- No duplicate write is committed.
- A conflicting request is rejected until key/payload consistency is restored.

**Common causes**:
- Same `Idempotency-Key` reused for a different payload
- Client retries while original request is still processing
- Very long-running request exceeded in-progress reclaim window

**Remediation**:
1. Verify retries use the same payload bytes for the same key.
2. For "already in progress", use exponential backoff and retry.
3. Stale in-progress keys are cleared by the background cleanup job (`AKASHI_IDEMPOTENCY_ABANDONED_TTL`).
4. Ensure key generation is unique per logical write operation.

---

### Outbox Dead Letters (attempts >= 10)

**Symptoms**: `SELECT count(*) FROM search_outbox WHERE attempts >= 10;` returns non-zero. Log line: `"search outbox: dead-letter entry"`.

**Impact**: Those specific decisions are not indexed in Qdrant. They exist in PostgreSQL and are queryable via SQL, but not via semantic search.

**Common causes**:
- Embedding dimension mismatch between Akashi config and Qdrant collection
- Qdrant collection deleted or renamed
- Persistent Qdrant connectivity issues

**Remediation**:
1. Inspect the error:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, decision_id, operation, attempts, last_error, created_at
   FROM search_outbox
   WHERE attempts >= 10
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 20;
   ```
2. Fix the underlying issue (restore collection, fix dimensions, etc.).
3. Reset attempts to allow retry:
   ```sql
   UPDATE search_outbox
   SET attempts = 0, locked_until = NULL
   WHERE attempts >= 10;
   ```
4. The outbox worker will pick them up on the next poll cycle.

**Automatic cleanup**: Dead-letter entries older than 7 days are archived to `search_outbox_dead_letters`, then removed from `search_outbox` (checked hourly).

### Rate Limiting (429s)

**Symptoms**: Agents receiving `429 Too Many Requests` responses. Log line: `"rate limit exceeded"`.

**Default limits**: 100 requests/second sustained, 200 burst per agent per org.

**Tuning**:

```sh
AKASHI_RATE_LIMIT_RPS=200      # Double the sustained rate
AKASHI_RATE_LIMIT_BURST=500    # Allow larger bursts
```

**Disable entirely** (not recommended for production):

```sh
AKASHI_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false
```

Platform admins are exempt from rate limiting. If a specific agent needs higher limits, either raise the global limit or promote the agent to platform_admin.

When Akashi runs behind a load balancer, set `AKASHI_TRUST_PROXY=true` so IP-based rate limits use the client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` instead of the proxy's address. Only enable when behind a trusted reverse proxy.

### Embedding Failures

**Symptoms**: Log line `"embedding: ... error"`. Decisions stored with `embedding = NULL`. Semantic search returns fewer results than expected.

**Common causes**:
- `AKASHI_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai` but `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset or invalid
- Ollama is down or unreachable (check `OLLAMA_URL` if using Ollama)
- Embedding dimension mismatch between `AKASHI_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` and model output

**Recovery**: Fix the provider, then restart the server. The startup backfill job will embed any decisions that have `embedding IS NULL`.

---

## 4. JWT Key Rotation

Akashi uses Ed25519 (EdDSA) for JWT signing. Keys are loaded from PEM files at startup.

### Generate a New Key Pair

```sh
openssl genpkey -algorithm Ed25519 -out akashi-private.pem
openssl pkey -in akashi-private.pem -pubout -out akashi-public.pem
chmod 600 akashi-private.pem akashi-public.pem
```

Key files **must** have permissions `0600` or stricter. The server refuses to start if they are world-readable.

### Rotate Keys

1. Generate new key pair (see above).
2. Place the files where the server can read them.
3. Update environment variables:
   ```sh
   AKASHI_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/new/akashi-private.pem
   AKASHI_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=/path/to/new/akashi-public.pem
   ```
4. Restart the Akashi process.

### Token Expiry Behavior

- Default token lifetime: 24 hours (`AKASHI_JWT_EXPIRATION`).
- After rotation, existing tokens signed with the old key will **fail validation immediately** because the server only holds one public key in memory.
- There is no token revocation list. To force all sessions to re-authenticate, rotate keys and restart.
- If you need zero-downtime rotation, coordinate with clients to re-authenticate within the restart window.

### Development Mode

If `AKASHI_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `AKASHI_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` are both unset, the server generates an ephemeral key pair in memory. Tokens are invalidated on every restart. **Never use this in production** -- a warning is logged at startup.

---

## 5. Database Operations

### Migrations

Migrations are managed by [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/). Files live in `migrations/` as sequential numbered SQL files.

```sh
# Apply pending migrations
atlas migrate apply --dir file://migrations --url "$DATABASE_URL"

# Validate migration integrity (checksums)
atlas migrate validate --dir file://migrations

# Rehash after modifying migration files
atlas migrate hash --dir file://migrations
```

**On startup**: by default, the server applies migrations from the embedded `migrations` package (built into the binary). Migration failure is fatal — the server will not start.

If you run Atlas externally in production, set:

```sh
AKASHI_SKIP_EMBEDDED_MIGRATIONS=true
```

This avoids startup migration races and keeps migration ownership with Atlas.

### Running migrations with ptah-compat

[`ptah-compat`](https://docs.ptah.run/edge/atlas/overview/) is an MIT-licensed drop-in for the Atlas CLI commands above. It reads the same `atlas.hcl`, verifies the same `atlas.sum`, and records into the same `atlas_schema_revisions` table, so either tool can continue a history the other started. The Makefile targets take it through `ATLAS`:

```sh
go install ptah.run/cmd/ptah-compat@<version>   # the version the migrations-ptah-compat CI job pins
make migrate-validate ATLAS=ptah-compat
make migrate-apply ATLAS=ptah-compat
make migrate-status ATLAS=ptah-compat
```

The `migrations-ptah-compat` CI job applies every migration with it on the same TimescaleDB image as `verify-exit-criteria`, then checks that `atlas migrate status` reads the result as fully applied.

Two behaviors differ from the Atlas CLI, and both matter for a `-- atlas:txmode none` migration such as `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`:

| | Atlas CLI v1.1.0 | ptah-compat |
|---|---|---|
| Another session holds a conflicting lock | the build waits for as long as the lock is held | a `-- +ptah lock_timeout=5s` header line fails the statement after 5s with SQLSTATE 55P03; Atlas reads the line as a comment |
| A concurrent unique index failed on duplicates, the data was fixed, and the migration runs again | `IF NOT EXISTS` skips the invalid index and the migration is recorded as applied | refuses to record the migration while `pg_index` reports the index invalid, and names `REINDEX` |

Details: [migration directives](https://docs.ptah.run/edge/versioned/apply/) and [where ptah-compat differs from Atlas](https://docs.ptah.run/edge/atlas/retained-divergences/#a-migration-that-would-be-recorded-over-an-invalid-index).

### Backup

Standard `pg_dump` works. Key tables by priority:

| Table                        | Notes                                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `organizations`              | Tenant configuration. Small. Always back up.                |
| `agents`                     | Auth identities. Small. Always back up.                     |
| `agent_runs`                 | Trace run metadata. Moderate size.                          |
| `agent_events`               | Append-only event log. Potentially very large. Consider partial or time-bounded backup. |
| `decisions`                  | Core decision data with embeddings. Can be large.           |
| `alternatives`               | Decision options. Required for complete decision reconstruction. |
| `evidence`                   | Decision evidence and citations.                            |
| `access_grants`              | RBAC grants. Small. Always back up.                         |
| `scored_conflicts`           | Conflict graph data used by conflict APIs.                  |
| `integrity_proofs`           | Merkle batch proofs for tamper/audit verification.          |
| `idempotency_keys`           | Replay safety records for write APIs.                       |
| `schema_migrations`          | Migration version tracking.                                 |
| `search_outbox`              | Pending sync queue for Qdrant.                              |
| `search_outbox_dead_letters` | Archived failed outbox entries (paper trail).               |
| `deletion_audit_log`         | Archived deleted records for destructive admin operations.   |
| `mutation_audit_log`         | Append-only ledger for API mutation paper trail.            |
| `agent_events_archive`       | Archived historical events moved out of the hot hypertable. |

```sh
# Full backup
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" -Fc -f akashi-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).dump

# Data-only backup of core tables (skip events)
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" -Fc --table=organizations --table=agents \
  --table=decisions --table=agent_runs --table=access_grants \
  -f akashi-core-$(date +%Y%m%d).dump
```

### Restore (Durability-Critical Procedure)

1. Stop all Akashi instances so no new writes arrive during restore.
2. Restore PostgreSQL from a known-good dump:
   ```sh
   pg_restore --clean --if-exists --no-owner --no-privileges \
     -d "$DATABASE_URL" akashi-backup-YYYYMMDD.dump
   ```
3. Start Akashi and verify health:
   ```sh
   curl -sf http://localhost:8080/health | jq .data
   ```
4. Run post-restore checks:
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM decisions WHERE valid_to IS NULL;
   SELECT count(*) FROM agent_runs;
   SELECT count(*) FROM agent_events;
   SELECT count(*) FROM search_outbox WHERE attempts < 10;
   ```
5. If Qdrant index state is stale or missing, repopulate outbox from current decisions, then allow worker replay:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO search_outbox (decision_id, org_id, operation)
   SELECT id, org_id, 'upsert'
   FROM decisions
   WHERE valid_to IS NULL AND embedding IS NOT NULL
   ON CONFLICT (decision_id, operation) DO UPDATE
      SET created_at = now(), attempts = 0, locked_until = NULL;
   ```

PostgreSQL is the source of truth. `search_outbox` is transient and cannot by itself reconstruct all historical sync intent after restore.

Automated verification helper:

```sh
# Verify restore invariants and table integrity checks
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... make verify-restore

# Optionally repopulate outbox from current decisions during drill recovery
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... REBUILD_OUTBOX=true make verify-restore
```

### Outbox Health Check

```sql
-- Overall sync status
SELECT count(*) AS pending,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE attempts > 0) AS retrying,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE attempts >= 10) AS dead_letter,
       max(attempts) AS max_attempts,
       min(created_at) AS oldest_entry
FROM search_outbox;

-- Recent errors
SELECT decision_id, operation, attempts, last_error, created_at
FROM search_outbox
WHERE last_error IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Postgres/Qdrant Reconciliation

Use reconciliation to detect and repair drift between PostgreSQL source-of-truth decisions and Qdrant indexed points.

```sh
# Detect drift (exit non-zero if mismatch exists)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... QDRANT_URL=https://...:6333 make reconcile-qdrant

# Repair missing Qdrant points by queueing outbox upserts
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... QDRANT_URL=https://...:6333 make reconcile-qdrant-repair
```

`reconcile-qdrant-repair` only queues missing entries into `search_outbox`; it does not delete extra Qdrant points automatically.

### Exit Criteria Verification

Use a single verifier to evaluate durability/consistency gates with structured JSON output:

```sh
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... make verify-exit-criteria
```

Optional thresholds:

- `MAX_DEAD_LETTERS` (default `0`)
- `MAX_OUTBOX_OLDEST_SECONDS` (default `1800`)
- `STRICT_RETENTION_CHECK` (default `false`)
- `RETAIN_DAYS` (default `90`, only used when strict retention is enabled)

When `QDRANT_URL` is set, the verifier also checks Postgres/Qdrant drift by running reconciliation in read-only mode.

### Branch Protection Policy

For protected branches (for example `main`), configure GitHub branch protection to require this status check before merge:

- `Verify Exit Criteria`

Recommended minimum required checks:

- `CI`
- `Build with UI`
- `Verify Exit Criteria`

### GDPR / Right-to-Erasure (Delete Agent Data)

Use the admin-only endpoint:

```http
DELETE /v1/agents/{agent_id}
Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt>
X-Akashi-Org-Id: <org-uuid>
```

This performs a transactional delete of the agent and related records (runs, events, decisions, access grants), and clears supersedes links that point at deleted decisions.
The endpoint is disabled by default; set `AKASHI_ENABLE_DESTRUCTIVE_DELETE=true` to allow execution.

### Event Retention and Archival (TimescaleDB)

`agent_events` is a Timescale hypertable and can grow quickly. Use archive-before-purge to preserve paper trail while controlling storage.

```sh
# Preview one archival window (safe default, no purge)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... make archive-events-dry-run

# Archive then purge one window (explicit destructive mode)
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... DRY_RUN=false ENABLE_PURGE=true make archive-events
```

Optional knobs:

- `RETAIN_DAYS` (default `90`) - keep recent events in primary hypertable
- `BATCH_DAYS` (default `1`) - process one bounded time window per run to reduce lock pressure

Archive destination:

- `agent_events_archive` holds immutable historical rows moved out of the hot hypertable.

### Connection Pool Monitoring

```sql
-- Active connections (run against PostgreSQL directly, not PgBouncer)
SELECT count(*) AS total,

## 6. Scaling Guidelines

### Single Instance Capacity

A single Akashi binary handles approximately 1,000 req/s on modest hardware (4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM). The event buffer and COPY-based batch writes amortize database round trips.

### Horizontal Scaling

Run multiple Akashi instances behind a load balancer.

| Component               | Scaling Behavior                                                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP API                | Stateless. Any instance can serve any request.                                    |
| Event buffer            | Per-instance. Each instance flushes its own buffer to PostgreSQL.                 |
| Outbox worker           | Per-instance. Uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` -- multiple workers safely share work.|
| LISTEN/NOTIFY           | Per-instance. Each instance maintains its own direct PostgreSQL connection.        |
| SSE broker              | Per-instance. Clients receive events only from the instance they are connected to.|
| JWT validation          | Stateless. All instances must have the same public key.                            |

### Bottlenecks

1. **PostgreSQL** is the primary bottleneck. Scale read replicas for query load. Consider connection pooling (PgBouncer) tuning.
2. **Qdrant** for vector search at scale. Monitor query latency via `http.server.duration` on `/v1/search`.

### SSE Limitation

SSE subscriptions are bound to the instance the client connects to. With multiple instances behind a load balancer, a client only receives events produced by its connected instance. For full coverage, clients should use polling (`GET /v1/decisions/recent`) or ensure sticky sessions.

## 7. Configuration Reference

See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for the full environment variable reference.

---

## 8. Graceful Shutdown

On `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`, the server shuts down in this order:

```
1. HTTP server drains           -- stops accepting new requests, completes in-flight (`AKASHI_SHUTDOWN_HTTP_TIMEOUT`)
2. Async post-trace drain       -- waits for in-flight claim generation and conflict scoring (`AKASHI_SHUTDOWN_ASYNC_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`)
3. Event buffer drains          -- final flush to PostgreSQL (`AKASHI_SHUTDOWN_BUFFER_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`)
4. Outbox worker drains         -- syncs remaining entries to Qdrant (`AKASHI_SHUTDOWN_OUTBOX_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`)
5. Cleanup                      -- grant cache, rate limiter, Qdrant client closed
6. OTEL flushes                 -- final trace/metric export
7. Database pool closes         -- PgBouncer pool + NOTIFY connection
```

There is no single shared shutdown timeout. Each phase has its own timeout, and setting a timeout to `0` waits indefinitely.

### Warnings

- **DO NOT** send `kill -9` during shutdown. If the event buffer is mid-flush, events in memory will be lost.
- Buffer drain is durability-critical and runs without a timeout. Do not force-stop the process while draining.
- The outbox worker drain timeout (log: `"search outbox: drain timed out"`) means some outbox entries were not synced to Qdrant. They remain in PostgreSQL and will sync on next startup.

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. Ensure load balancer has stopped sending traffic (remove from target group or mark unhealthy).
2. Send `SIGTERM`.
3. Wait for exit (can be indefinite when drain timeouts are set to `0`).
4. Verify clean shutdown: log line `"akashi stopped"` with exit code 0.

## 9. Quick Diagnostic Commands

```sh
# Is the server running?
curl -sf http://localhost:8080/health | jq .data.status

# Outbox sync status
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  SELECT count(*) AS pending,
         count(*) FILTER (WHERE attempts > 0) AS retrying,
         count(*) FILTER (WHERE attempts >= 10) AS dead_letter
  FROM search_outbox;
"

# Recent outbox errors
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  SELECT decision_id, attempts, last_error, created_at
  FROM search_outbox
  WHERE last_error IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
"

# Decision count per org (capacity check)
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  SELECT o.name, count(d.id) AS decisions
  FROM organizations o
  LEFT JOIN decisions d ON d.org_id = o.id AND d.valid_to IS NULL
  GROUP BY o.name
  ORDER BY decisions DESC;
"

# Active PostgreSQL connections
psql "$NOTIFY_URL" -c "
  SELECT count(*) AS total,
         count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'active') AS active
  FROM pg_stat_activity
  WHERE datname = 'akashi';
"

# Reset dead-letter outbox entries after fixing root cause
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  UPDATE search_outbox SET attempts = 0, locked_until = NULL WHERE attempts >= 10;
"
```

## 10. Conflict Detection Evaluation

Akashi detects conflicts between agent decisions using an embedding-based scorer followed by an optional LLM validator.

> **Read [conflict-detection.md](conflict-detection.md) and [ADR-017](../adrs/ADR-017-conflict-detection-operating-point.md) before acting on anything in this section.** They carry the measured behaviour, and two of the instincts this section supports have been measured and rejected on the production corpus:
>
> - **Tuning scorer thresholds does not buy precision.** Contradictions are 3.35% of scored pairs, and no scorer feature separates them (best AUC 0.601, CI 0.54–0.66). Thresholds change throughput and cost, not the precision of what survives. The judge model is the discriminating component: `gpt-4o-mini` runs at ~8% queue precision, `gpt-5` at ~41.5%.
> - **The hand-written validator dataset cannot falsify the detector.** `DefaultEvalDataset` scored 1.000 precision / 1.000 recall while the shipped detector was running at 3.4% precision in production. An eval set written from the same intuitions as the prompt will always pass.
>
> The authoritative measurement is `--mode=gold` against `conflict_gold_labels`, described in [conflict-detection.md §3](conflict-detection.md). The label-based scorer eval below remains useful for one thing only: telling you how noisy *your* queue is right now.

### Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Scorer** | Embedding similarity pipeline that flags candidate conflicts. Fast, cheap, always on. |
| **Validator** | LLM-based second pass that confirms or rejects scorer candidates. Slower, costs API tokens. |
| **Ground truth label** | Human judgment on a detected conflict: was it real? |

### Label Types

Every detected conflict (in `scored_conflicts`) can be labeled with one of three values:

| Label | Meaning | Scorer eval role |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `genuine` | Real conflict — the decisions truly contradict each other | True positive |
| `related_not_contradicting` | Same topic but not actually contradictory (e.g. paraphrases) | False positive |
| `unrelated_false_positive` | Different topics entirely — should not have been flagged | False positive |

Resolution endpoints also create labels automatically: resolving with a declared
winner labels the conflict `genuine`, while marking a conflict `false_positive`
labels it with `false_positive_label` (default `unrelated_false_positive`).

### Labeling Conflicts via API

All label endpoints require admin authentication.

```sh
# Authenticate
TOKEN=$(curl -s http://localhost:8081/auth/token \
  -d '{"agent_id":"admin","api_key":"ak_..."}' | jq -r .token)

# List detected conflicts to find IDs to label
curl -s http://localhost:8081/v1/conflicts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.conflicts[:5]'

# Label a conflict as genuine
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8081/v1/admin/conflicts/{id}/label \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label": "genuine", "notes": "clearly opposite caching strategies"}'

# Label a conflict as false positive
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8081/v1/admin/conflicts/{id}/label \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label": "related_not_contradicting", "notes": "same decision, different wording"}'

# View a label
curl -s http://localhost:8081/v1/admin/conflicts/{id}/label \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .

# List all labels with counts
curl -s http://localhost:8081/v1/admin/conflict-labels \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq .

# Delete a label (to re-label)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8081/v1/admin/conflicts/{id}/label \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Amending Resolution Notes

If a terminal conflict has a mis-keyed resolution note, amend the note through
the admin route instead of reopening the conflict:

```sh
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8081/v1/admin/conflicts/{id}/resolution-note \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"resolution_note": "corrected rationale for this conflict"}'
```

Open conflicts return `400`; resolve or mark them false-positive first.

### Reducing False Positives

**Change the judge model first.** It is the only lever measured to move precision, and by a
factor of five:

```sh
export AKASHI_CONFLICT_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5   # default gpt-4o-mini: ~8% queue precision
export AKASHI_CONFLICT_LLM_TIMEOUT=120s     # MANDATORY: at the 15s default, gpt-5 failed 159/200 calls
```

The timeout is not optional. A validation timeout is fail-safe — the candidate is skipped, not
flagged — so too low a value produces no error and no alert, only a quiet drop in detections
that reads exactly like "the new model is more precise." After switching, check
`akashi.conflicts.llm_calls{result="timeout"}` before concluding anything.

The `high_precision` profile is a throughput and cost lever, not a precision lever — its
thresholds sit on the diagonal, removing true and false positives in the same proportion. Use
it to shrink the queue, not to clean it:

```sh
export AKASHI_CONFLICT_PROFILE=high_precision
export AKASHI_FORCE_CONFLICT_RESCORE=true
```

Restart once with both variables set, wait for the rescore to complete, then remove
`AKASHI_FORCE_CONFLICT_RESCORE` so future restarts do not clear and rebuild the conflict
table again. On a large corpus, bound the cost first with `AKASHI_CONFLICT_BACKFILL_WINDOW`
(e.g. `720h`) — a forced rescore re-judges every surviving candidate pair at one LLM call
each.

### Running Scorer Eval (Precision from Labels)

Once you have labeled conflicts, compute scorer precision. This measures what fraction of the scorer's detections are genuine conflicts.

**Precision = genuine / (genuine + related_not_contradicting + unrelated_false_positive)**

Note: recall cannot be computed from labels alone because labels only cover *detected* conflicts. Measuring recall requires a separate dataset of known conflicts that should have been detected.

```sh
# Via CLI (recommended)
export AKASHI_URL=http://localhost:8081
export AKASHI_AGENT_ID=admin
export AKASHI_API_KEY=ak_...

go run ./cmd/eval-conflicts --mode=scorer

# Save results to ./eval-results/
go run ./cmd/eval-conflicts --mode=scorer --save

# Via API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/admin/scorer-eval \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' | jq .
```

Example output:

```
Scorer Precision: 85.7% (6 TP, 1 FP, 7 labeled)
```

### Running Validator Eval (LLM Accuracy)

The validator eval runs a hardcoded dataset of decision pairs through the LLM validator and reports precision and recall of the LLM's conflict/no-conflict judgments.

> **This number is not evidence of detection quality.** The dataset was written alongside the
> prompt it tests, and it scored a perfect 1.000/1.000 while the shipped detector was running
> at 3.4% precision in production. Treat it as a smoke test that the validator is wired up and
> parsing responses — nothing more. For a number you can act on, use `--mode=gold`
> ([conflict-detection.md §3](conflict-detection.md)).

```sh
export AKASHI_URL=http://localhost:8081
export AKASHI_AGENT_ID=admin
export AKASHI_API_KEY=ak_...

# Run validator eval (requires LLM API access — costs tokens)
go run ./cmd/eval-conflicts --mode=validator

# Save results
go run ./cmd/eval-conflicts --mode=validator --save
```

The validator eval requires the akashi server to have a working embedding/LLM provider configured.

### Saving and Reviewing Results

The `--save` flag writes JSON results to `./eval-results/`:

```
eval-results/
  scorer_2026-03-07T14-30-00.json
  validator_2026-03-07T14-35-00.json
```

This directory is gitignored. Results accumulate locally so you can track precision over time as you tune scorer thresholds or retrain embeddings.

### Synthetic Benchmark (Development Only)

A 300-pair synthetic dataset tests the scorer's embedding math in isolation (not real detection quality). This is gated behind an environment variable and requires a running TimescaleDB with testcontainers:

```sh
AKASHI_BENCH=1 go test -run TestScorerPrecisionRecall ./internal/conflicts/ -v
```

This is useful for verifying that threshold changes don't break the scorer's ability to distinguish orthogonal embeddings. It does not test real-world detection quality — use the label-based eval for that.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AKASHI_URL` | `http://localhost:8081` | Base URL of the akashi instance to evaluate |
| `AKASHI_AGENT_ID` | (required) | Agent ID for authentication |
| `AKASHI_API_KEY` | (required) | API key for admin authentication |

### Recommended Workflow

1. Run your akashi instance locally on port 8081.
2. Exercise the system — trace decisions, let the scorer detect conflicts.
3. Review detected conflicts via the UI or `GET /v1/conflicts`.
4. Label 20+ conflicts across all three categories.
5. Run `go run ./cmd/eval-conflicts --mode=scorer --save` to get your queue's current precision.
6. If it is low, **change the judge model** (see "Reducing False Positives" above). Do not
   reach for `AKASHI_CONFLICT_SIGNIFICANCE_THRESHOLD` or the early-exit floor — measured
   against 2,772 blind gold labels, no scorer-feature threshold separates contradictions from
   the rest, so tuning them shrinks the queue without cleaning it.
7. Re-run the scorer eval after the model change, and after any embedding change, to catch
   regressions.

To go further than "how noisy is my queue" — comparing judges, measuring majority-class
false-positive rate, or choosing an operating point against your own miss:false-alarm cost
ratio — build a blind-labelled corpus and use `--mode=gold`. The procedure, including what an
outside contributor can offer without access to the maintainer's corpus, is in
[conflict-detection.md §3](conflict-detection.md).
